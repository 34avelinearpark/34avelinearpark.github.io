      <h1>Support for a Linear Park in Jackson Heights</span></h1><br>
      <div class="textBox" style="text-align: left"><p>Since the launch of our petition in May 2021, over 2,500 people have signed on in support of a permanent park on 34th Avenue, currently home to one of the city's most successful Open Streets. As our community recovers from the Covid-19 pandemic, the potential for new, permanent greenspace in Jackson Heights has activated the imagination of our neighbors and fellow open space advocates and energized a discussion about environmental equity. A selection of the comments submitted to us through the petition are shared below.</p><p><span style="font-size: 16px">Some comments were edited for length.<span></p></div><br>

        <div class="filterDiv community show">x Just as Travers Park has become a focal place for community, so has 34th Avenue brought residents, visitors, and those who work in the neighborhood together. <b>As we look to the future, innovative infrastructural and design changes are needed </b>to sustain + improve upon the success of the all-volunteer Open Streets program.</b></div>
        <div class="filterDiv health-safety show">x <b>We are a community of both great diversity and immense disparity.</b> In 2020, we were in the epicenter of the Covid-19 epicenter. As we grapple with a public health emergency like none other in recent history, existing inequities are all the more pronounced. <b>Good open spaces are one just component</b> to achieving a more equitable city.</div>
        <div class="filterDiv open-space show">x&nbsp;<b>JH ranks among the lowest</b> in per capita green space. Uniquely, unlike many of the city's Open Streets, 34th Avenue is residential. <b>The Jackson Heights community has made the 34th Avenue Open Street its very own</b> with personal touches ranging from gardens to activity spaces for all ages. But there's still work to be done to meet the gap in open space.</div>
        <div class="filterDiv visions show">x For every user of our current Open Street, there is a different vision for what permanent green space in Jackson Heights could look like. We strongly believe that the City should adopt a <b>community-based approach</b> to 34th Avenue that <b>builds upon the work and successes</b> of the community, which helped harness the potential in these 26 blocks.</div>
        <div class="filterDiv community show">x&nbsp;community<br><br><span style="color: #000;">“I use this almost every day for play, exercise, commute. I have a car but am more than happy to give up a little parking for this amazing community asset that everyone can share.”</span></div>

The neighborhood needs more parks an green areas for walking and exercise without the danger of cars constantly passing around. Thank you for this initiative!”</span></div>
        <div class="filterDiv open-space show">x open space<br><br><span style="color: #000;">“The 34th Street promenade is an incredible improvement to the Jackson Heights neighborhood. With so little existing dedicated green space in the neighborhood, 34th Ave for pedestrians opens up the whole neighborhood in a important community-building way.”</span></div>
        <div class="filterDiv visions show">x&nbsp;visions<br><br><span style="color: #000;">“34th Street has been such a wonderful pedestrian space, sorely needed in our neighborhood! I support making it permanent and safe. I would also love if we could find some space for our (many) neighborhood dogs to run off leash!”</span></div>
        <div class="filterDiv community show">x&nbsp;community<br><br><span style="color: #000;">“34th Ave’s closure has created a community hub that gives me enormous pride as a Jackson Heights resident and allows me to feel even more connected and enmeshed in our vibrant community.”</span></div>
        <div class="filterDiv health-safety show">x&nbsp;health &amp; safety<br><br><span style="color: #000; font-size: 15px">“Seria genial tener un parque en 34av. La calle abierta está ayudando a mi hija a salir de su depresión... Ella es muy tímida y se pone nerviosa con la multitud o al interactuar con la gente pero ahora ella poco a poco esta logrando salir de su burbuja. Por favor apoyen este proyecto será muy beneficioso para la comunidad.”</span></div>

Many of my students benefit from the Open Streets program. The creation of the linear park would improve the mental, physical, emotional, and social health of my students, who currently have access to less green space than almost anyone else in NYC. This is an imperative... if we want to build an equitable future for all of our children.”</span></div>
        <div class="filterDiv health-safety show">x&nbsp;health &amp; safety<br><span style="color: #000; font-size: 14px">“This Open Street saved my mental and physical health during this past year. Seeing people coming together on it, enjoying the fresh air and the proximiity to trees has been a delight... Please turn 34th avenue into a haven where we can be in greater contact with nature and other human beings, not shut up in cars and careless of the fact that people deserve access to public spaces...”</span></div>
        <div class="filterDiv open-space show">x open space<br><span style="color: #000; font-size: 14px">“34th Ave being made accessible for pedestrians, cyclists, and runners has been an amazing experience, especially during the pandemic, which necessitated staying at home or close to home... We need more space to walk and play, and having this expanded park space would significantly continue to improve quality of life for residents in this community!”</span></div>
        <div class="filterDiv visions show">x&nbsp;visions<br><br><span style="color: #000;">“Please -- open air, less traffic, more fun, more community, more peace, more joy in The City. The sunflowers and other plantings on the avenue seem like a harbinger of good things to come. Open bike path to Flushing Meadows Park. Growth. Lovely.”</span></div>

It’s been so wonderful for our community. My daughter loves it; she can ride her bike or skateboard safely and meet up with friends. There have been so many wonderful programs for people of all ages. The Open Street adds much-needed parkland to our community, which otherwise has so little of it. Please make our street permanent!”</span></div>

        <div class="filterDiv open-space show">x open space<br><br><span style="color: #000;">“I grew up in Jackson Heights before the renovation of Travers Park and there was a serious lack of public green space for the community.

        <div class="filterDiv visions show">x&nbsp;visions<br><br><span style="color: #000;">“I dream of a linear park, with a nice 2-way bike path and a separate area for walking, playing. Each block will probably need its own treatment, as every block is different from the next, but it could be so wonderful. I hope city leaders help us realize this vision.”</span></div>
